## Introduction

This project assumes that you've already built a motorised buggy, similar to the one in the [Build a buggy resource](../build-a-buggy).

With your buggy built it is time to add in mechanisms to allow you to remote control the buggy using one of the following methods:

1. An Android device
2. A Wiimote
3. A Google AIY Voice Kit
