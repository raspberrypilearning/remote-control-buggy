## Introduction

This project assumes that you've already built a motorised buggy controlled by a Raspberry Pi, such as the one in the [Build a buggy resource](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/build-a-buggy).

With your buggy built, it is now time to add in mechanisms to allow you to remotely control the buggy using one of the following devices:

1. An Android phone (or tablet)
2. A Google AIY Projects Voice Kit
3. A home-brew remote control

## What you will learn

- How to receive input from an Android device on your Raspberry Pi
- How to use GPIO pins remotely to control a robot buggy
- How to process data from an AIY Projects Voice Kit to control a robot buggy

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://curriculum.raspberrypi.org/):

- [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem](https://curriculum.raspberrypi.org/programming/builder/)
- [Combine inputs and/or outputs to create projects or solve a problem](https://curriculum.raspberrypi.org/physical-computing/builder/)
- [Use basic materials and tools to create project prototypes/](https://curriculum.raspberrypi.org/manufacture/creator/)
